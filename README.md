## Overview
An application that can generate strong passwords quickly and effortlessly that saves employees time and ensures secure access to data.

## Description
Using a variety of functions and events,this application generates a unique password based on selected criteria. The password length must be between 8-128 characters, and consist of at least one type of character (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols). By using a function to get random characters from 4 sets of arrays, we can identify which characters will be filtered into the generated password based on the checkbox elements assigned to each character type. Then we use a "for loop" to fill the new generated password string until it has the desired amount of characters. The application works quickly, and efficiently to produce strong passwords. 

## Useage
Use to randomly generate secure passwords for frequent password updates to maintain the highest level of security.

This instructional video made this assignment possible. I was very stuck on where to start, and how to connect the pieces within the script. I now have a better understanding of how the javascript writing process flows, and essentially follows the patterns of initial pseudocoding.
